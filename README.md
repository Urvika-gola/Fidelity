# Fidelity
This android application was create an application version of Amazon Echo.
Fidelity wanted to find a way to provide Echo users with real-time insights into market trends,
by building a voice experience with Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) .
Now, with the Fidelity skill, anyone with an Alexa-enabled device can get a market update or a quote for publicly 
listed companies by simply enabling the skill and then saying “Alexa, Ask Fidelity how [Company Name] is doing.”
